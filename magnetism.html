                    <p>A naturally occurring material known as <strong>lodestone</strong>, a form of iron ore, attracts some materials brought near it.</p>
                    <p>When a bar of lodestone is suspended freely, it settles in the <strong>north-south direction</strong>.</p>
                    <p>This property of lodestone has been used to make present-day magnets.</p>
                    <p>Magnets attract certain materials known as <strong>magnetic materials</strong>. Examples include iron, nickel, cobalt, and their alloys. Magnets are made from these materials.</p>
                    <p>Materials like copper, brass, aluminium, wood, glass, and plastics are considered <strong>non-magnetic materials</strong> as they are not attracted by a magnet. These objects have very weak magnetic properties.</p>
                    <p>Metals such as cobalt, iron, and nickel, along with their alloys, are strongly attracted by magnets and are called <strong>ferromagnetic materials</strong>.</p>

                    <p>The pole which points towards the north is called the <strong>North-seeking</strong> or <strong>north (N) pole</strong>; the other one is the <strong>south-seeking</strong> or <strong>south (S) pole</strong>.</p>
