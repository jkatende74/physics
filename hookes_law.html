                content: `
                    <p>Hooke's Law is a fundamental principle in physics that describes the relationship between the force applied to stretch (or compress) an elastic material and the resulting change in its length.</p>
                    <p>The Core Statement: Hooke's Law states that for a <strong>helical spring or other elastic material</strong>, the <strong>extension</strong> (the increase in length) is <strong>directly proportional</strong> to the <strong>stretching force</strong> (the force applied).</p>
                    <p>The Crucial Condition: This direct proportionality <strong>only holds true provided the elastic limit is not exceeded</strong>.</p>
                `,
                explanation: "Hooke's Law is all about how stretchy things behave. Basically, for things like springs, the more you pull them (force), the more they stretch (extension) – and it's a consistent relationship, as long as you don't pull too hard and break or permanently stretch them!",
                diagramPlaceholder: "[Diagram: A simple helical spring shown in three states: 1. Unstretched. 2. Stretched by a small force F, showing extension e. 3. Stretched by a larger force 2F, showing extension 2e.]"

            {
                title: "Understanding Direct Proportionality & The Spring Constant (k)",
                content: `
                    <h3>Understanding Direct Proportionality</h3>
                    <p>Direct proportionality means that if you double the stretching force, the extension will also double. If you triple the force, the extension triples, and so on, as long as you stay within the material's elastic limit.</p>
                    <h3>Mathematical Expression:</h3>
                    <p>This relationship can be written mathematically as: <strong>F ∝ e</strong> where:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>F</strong> represents the stretching force (or load).</li>
                        <li><strong>e</strong> represents the extension (the increase in length).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Introducing the Spring Constant:</h3>
                    <p>To turn this proportionality into an equation, we introduce a constant of proportionality, traditionally denoted by <strong>k</strong>. The equation becomes: <strong>F = ke</strong></p>
                    <p>Here, <strong>k</strong> is known as the <strong>spring constant</strong>.</p>
                `,
                explanation: "Directly proportional means if one thing doubles, the other doubles too. So, more force = more stretch in a predictable way. We write this as F ∝ e. To make it an equation, we use 'k', the spring constant: F = ke. 'k' tells us how stiff the spring is.",

            {
                title: "The Spring Constant (k): Meaning and Units",
                content: `
                    <p>The value of 'k' <strong>depends on the material</strong> of the spring. A stiffer material will have a higher spring constant, meaning you need a larger force to produce the same amount of extension compared to a less stiff material.</p>
                    <p>The units for the spring constant are typically given as <strong>N/m</strong> (Newtons per metre) or <strong>Nm⁻¹</strong>.</p>
                    <h3>Graphical Representation:</h3>
                    <p>If you perform an experiment and plot the stretching force (F) on the y-axis against the extension (e) on the x-axis, the graph for a material obeying Hooke's Law within its elastic limit will be a <strong>straight line passing through the origin</strong>. The <strong>gradient (slope) of this straight line is equal to the spring constant, k</strong>.</p>
                `,
                explanation: "A big 'k' value means a stiff spring (hard to stretch). A small 'k' means a loose spring (easy to stretch). We measure 'k' in Newtons per meter (N/m). If you plot Force vs. Extension on a graph, the steepness (gradient) of the straight line gives you 'k'.",
                diagramPlaceholder: "[Diagram: A graph of Force (F, y-axis) vs. Extension (e, x-axis) showing a straight line passing through the origin. Indicate that the gradient of this line = k (spring constant).]"

                    <h3>Stretching/Extension:</h3>
                    <p>This is simply the increase in the length of the spring or elastic material from its original, unstretched length when a force is applied to pull it.</p>
                    <h3>Stretching Force (Load):</h3>
                    <p>This is the external force that is applied to the material, causing it to stretch.</p>
                    <h3>Elastic Material:</h3>
                    <p>An elastic material has the ability to <strong>return to its original length (or shape and size)</strong> once the stretching force is removed. This recovery happens as long as the applied force was not too large (i.e., within the elastic limit). Examples include helical springs and straight steel wires. Some materials like rubber also show elasticity even if their stretching might not perfectly follow Hooke's Law. Materials that do not recover but remain permanently deformed after force removal are called <strong>plastic</strong>.</p>
                `,
                explanation: "'Extension' is how much longer the spring gets. 'Stretching force' is the pull you apply. An 'elastic material' (like a spring or rubber band) bounces back to its original shape after you stop pulling, unless you pull too hard. If it stays stretched, it's become 'plastic'.",

                    <h3>The Elastic Limit:</h3>
                    <p>This is a crucial point for an elastic material. If you increase the stretching force beyond a certain value, called the elastic limit, the material will no longer return to its original length when the force is removed. On a force-extension graph, this point might be labelled as 'E'.</p>
                    <h3>Permanent Stretching/Extension:</h3>
                    <p>When the elastic limit is exceeded (for example, at a point like 'B' on a graph beyond 'E'), the material undergoes permanent stretching. This means that even after the stretching force is completely removed, the material will be left with some residual extension and will not fully regain its initial length.</p>
                `,
                explanation: "The 'elastic limit' is like the spring's breaking point for bounciness. If you stretch it beyond this limit, it won't go back to its original size – it gets permanently stretched out.",

                content: `
                    <p>When you stretch a spring or elastic material, you are applying a force over a distance (the extension), which means you are doing <strong>work</strong>.</p>
                    <p>The total work done in stretching the spring can be found by calculating the <strong>area under the force versus extension graph</strong>.</p>
                    <p>If the force increases linearly with extension (as per Hooke's Law), the graph is a triangle. The work done is given by the formula: <strong>Work Done = ½ × Force × Extension = ½ Fe</strong></p>
                    <p>Using the relationship F = ke, this formula can also be written as: <strong>Work Done = ½ k e²</strong></p>
                `,
                explanation: "Stretching a spring takes energy (work). On a Force-Extension graph, the work done is the area under the line. For a spring obeying Hooke's Law, this area is a triangle, so Work Done = ½ × Force × Extension, or ½ × k × (extension)².",

                    <p><strong>Compression:</strong> Hooke's Law also applies when you squeeze the ends of a spring together, causing it to shorten or undergo compression. The spring resists this compression with a counter force.</p>
                    <p>The relationship between this compression force and the amount of shortening also follows Hooke's Law up to a point. However, if the compression force becomes too large, the coils of the spring will press against each other, and further increases in force will result in very little additional shortening.</p>
                `,
                explanation: "Hooke's Law isn't just for stretching; it also works for squashing (compressing) a spring! The more you squash it, the harder it pushes back, up to a point. If you squash it too much, the coils touch, and it can't really get shorter.",

                    <ol>
                        <li>Set up the spring vertically with the metre rule alongside. Record initial pointer position (no load).</li>
                        <li>Add masses in steps (e.g., 20g), record new pointer position. Calculate extension (new reading - initial reading). Convert mass to force (F=mg).</li>
