                    <p>This chapter considers the reflection of light by curved surfaces, following up on reflection by plane mirrors from Book One.</p>
                    <p>Curved surfaces have a wide range of scientific and practical applications, such as in shaving mirrors, driving mirrors, searchlights, and telescopes.</p>
                `,

                content: `
                    <p>Curved surfaces can be obtained from hollow shapes like spheres, cones, or cylinders. When these surfaces are highly polished, they act as reflectors.</p>
                    <p>From a hollow metal sphere, if the inner surface is highly polished, the portion is a <strong>concave reflector</strong>. If the outer surface is highly polished, it is a <strong>convex reflector</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Curved mirrors can be made by applying silvery paint on part of a hollow glass sphere, cylinder, or cone.</p>
                    <p>A reflecting surface curving inwards is called a <strong>concave mirror</strong>. A reflecting surface bulging outwards is called a <strong>convex mirror</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Mirrors made from spheres are called <strong>spherical mirrors</strong>.</p>
                    <p>A <strong>parabolic mirror</strong> is a special curved mirror cut from a section of a cone. A concave parabolic reflector is obtained by applying silvery paint on the outside of the cone.</p>
                `,
                explanation: "Imagine a shiny ball. If the inside part is like a mirror, it's 'concave' (like a cave). If the outside part is the mirror, it's 'convex' (bulging out). Most curved mirrors we study are parts of spheres, but there are also special 'parabolic' ones.",

                    <p>The <strong>principal focus (F)</strong> is a point on the principal axis. For a concave mirror, it is the point where all rays parallel and close to the principal axis converge after reflection. For a convex mirror, it is the point from which these rays appear to diverge after reflection.</p>
                    <p>The principal focus of a concave mirror is a <strong>real focus</strong> because reflected rays actually pass through it. The principal focus of a convex mirror is a <strong>virtual focus</strong> because reflected rays only appear to pass through it.</p>

                    <p>Concave mirrors cause parallel rays to converge at the principal focus F after reflection. Convex mirrors cause parallel rays to be reflected so that they appear to diverge from the principal focus F behind the mirror.</p>
                    <p>If a ray converges at the principal focus (for concave) or appears to be directed towards it (for convex), it is reflected as a parallel beam.</p>
                    <p>This behavior demonstrates the <strong>principle of reversibility of light</strong>, which states that light will follow the same path if its direction is reversed.</p>
                    <p>Reflection by curved mirrors <strong>obeys the laws of reflection</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>

                `,
                explanation: "Light behaves predictably! Concave mirrors bring parallel rays together at F. Convex mirrors spread them out as if from F. Light can also go the other way (reversibility). The basic rules of reflection (angle in = angle out) still apply, and the 'normal' line at any point on a curved mirror always points through C. A key fact: focal length (f) is half the radius of curvature (r), so f = r/2.",

                    <p>Ray diagrams are used to explain how images are formed by curved mirrors and their characteristics. The reflecting surface is represented by a straight line with a small curve indicating the mirror type. The object is shown as a straight line perpendicular to the principal axis.</p>

                explanation: "To figure out where an image will form, we draw 'ray diagrams'. We use a few easy-to-draw rays: 1. A ray going through C bounces straight back. 2. A ray parallel to the main axis goes through F (or looks like it came from F). 3. A ray going through F (or aiming at F) bounces off parallel to the main axis. 4. A ray hitting the pole (P) bounces off at the same angle.",
