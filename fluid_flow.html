                    <p>The term 'fluid' includes <strong>gases and liquids</strong>[cite: 2].</p>
                    <p>A fluid flows because of a <strong>pressure difference</strong>[cite: 2].</p>
                    <p>Flowing fluids exhibit internal friction between layers, known as <strong>viscosity</strong>[cite: 3].</p>
                    <p>In the discussions presented in the sources regarding the equation of continuity and Bernoulli's principle, it is <strong>assumed that the viscosity of any fluid is negligible</strong>[cite: 4].</p>
                `,
                explanation: "A 'fluid' isn't just liquid; it includes gases too! Think of air or water. Fluids move from high pressure areas to low pressure areas. They also have an internal 'stickiness' called viscosity, but for many basic physics problems, we pretend this stickiness is almost zero to make things simpler.",

                title: "Types of Flow: Streamline (Steady) Flow",
                content: `
                    <p>Fluid flow can be categorized as streamline (steady), laminar, or turbulent[cite: 5].</p>
                    <p><strong>Streamline (Steady) Flow:</strong> This occurs if all fluid particles passing through a specific point have the <strong>same velocity</strong>[cite: 6]. The path of these particles is called a <strong>line of flow</strong>[cite: 7].</p>
                    <p>A streamline is a curve tangent to the direction of displacement of fluid particles at a point[cite: 8]. When the streamline and line of flow match, the flow is steady or streamline[cite: 9].</p>
                    <p><strong>Streamlines do not cross each other</strong>[cite: 10]. Streamlined bodies do not affect the distribution of streamlines behind them[cite: 11].</p>
                `,
                explanation: "Streamline flow is smooth and predictable. Imagine tiny particles in water all following the exact same path and speed as the ones before them at any given spot. These paths are 'streamlines,' and they never cross, like neat lanes of traffic.",

                title: "Types of Flow: Laminar & Turbulent Flow",
                content: `
                    <p><strong>Laminar Flow:</strong> This term is sometimes used interchangeably with steady flow[cite: 12]. It describes a fluid moving in layers or streamlines, where particles in a given layer have the same velocity, although this velocity may differ from particles in parallel layers[cite: 13].</p>
                    <p><strong>Turbulent Flow:</strong> This happens when the <strong>speed and direction</strong> of fluid particles at a point <strong>change over time</strong>[cite: 14]. Turbulent fluid flow involves the breaking of streamlines into ripples or eddies[cite: 15]. Non-streamlined shapes produce <strong>eddies (turbulence)</strong> behind them, which causes a <strong>drag</strong> on the moving shapes[cite: 16].</p>
                    <p>Turbulence begins when the fluid flow exceeds a certain velocity called <strong>critical velocity</strong>[cite: 17].</p>
                `,
                explanation: "Laminar flow is like streamline flow – smooth layers. Turbulent flow is the opposite: messy, chaotic, and full of swirls (eddies), like water rushing rapidly around a rock. This turbulence creates 'drag,' which tries to slow things down. Flow becomes turbulent if it goes too fast (above its 'critical velocity').",

            {
                title: "Effects of Objects & Speed on Flow",
                content: `
                    <p>Experiments involving moving objects through fluids illustrate how shape and speed affect flow[cite: 18].</p>
                    <p>Using a ruler in water: Moving it with the sharp edge required less effort and caused fewer ripples (turbulent flow) than using the blunt side[cite: 19].</p>
                    <p>Objects with <strong>sharper or pointed ends needed less force</strong> because they caused less turbulence (drag effect)[cite: 20]. Objects with <strong>streamlined shapes</strong> also cause less turbulence[cite: 21].</p>
                    <p><strong>Streamlined shapes</strong> are designed to cut easily through fluids and minimize the formation of eddies behind them, thus reducing resistance to motion[cite: 22]. Examples include fish, birds, cars, jets, ships, submarines, and rockets[cite: 23].</p>
                    <p>The <strong>speed of flow affects streamlines</strong>[cite: 24]. An experiment using potassium permanganate in water flowing through a glass tube showed that at low speeds, a fine coloured stream indicated steady flow[cite: 25]. When the water flow rate increased, the velocity increased rapidly, breaking the coloured stream and showing that <strong>turbulence had set in</strong>[cite: 26]. Turbulence starts when the fluid velocity exceeds the <strong>critical velocity</strong>[cite: 27].</p>
                `,
                explanation: "The shape of an object moving through a fluid really matters! Sharp, 'streamlined' shapes (like a fish or an airplane wing) cause less messy flow (turbulence) and less drag than blunt shapes. Also, if fluid flows too fast, even smooth flow can become turbulent.",
                diagramPlaceholder: "[Diagram: Show a blunt object and a streamlined object moving through a fluid. Illustrate more turbulence/eddies behind the blunt object and smoother flow around the streamlined one. Optional: A separate diagram illustrating the potassium permanganate experiment: smooth coloured line at low speed, breaking up at high speed.]"

                title: "Equation of Continuity: Assumptions & Flux",
                content: `
                    <p>This equation is based on assumptions of <strong>steady flow, incompressible fluid</strong> (insignificant density change with pressure), and <strong>non-viscous fluid</strong>[cite: 28].</p>
                    <p><strong>Volume Flux (Flow Rate):</strong> This is defined as the <strong>volume of fluid passing through a given section of a tube of flow per unit time</strong>[cite: 29]. If A is the cross-sectional area and v is the velocity, Volume flux = <strong>Area × velocity = Av</strong>[cite: 30]. The SI unit is <strong>m³/s</strong>[cite: 31].</p>
                    <p><strong>Mass Flux:</strong> This is the <strong>mass of fluid flowing through a given section per unit time</strong>[cite: 32]. Mass flux = density × volume flux = <strong>ρAv</strong>[cite: 33]. The unit is <strong>kg/s</strong>[cite: 34].</p>
                `,
                explanation: "The 'Equation of Continuity' is a rule for fluids that don't compress (like water) and aren't too sticky (non-viscous), and are flowing smoothly. 'Volume flux' is how much volume of fluid passes a point each second (Area x velocity). 'Mass flux' is how much mass of fluid passes each second (density x Area x velocity).",

            {
                title: "Equation of Continuity: The Principle",
                content: `
                    <p>For an incompressible fluid (density ρ is constant) in a tube of flow, the <strong>mass entering a section equals the mass leaving another section in the same time</strong> (mass is conserved)[cite: 35].</p>
                    <p>This leads to the <strong>Equation of Continuity: A₁v₁ = A₂v₂</strong>[cite: 36].</p>
                    <p>This equation means that the product of the cross-sectional area (A) and the fluid velocity (v) is <strong>constant (Av = k)</strong> for steady, non-viscous flow[cite: 37].</p>
                    <p>Consequently, the <strong>area of cross-section is inversely proportional to the velocity</strong> of the fluid[cite: 38].</p>
                    <p>The fluid speed <strong>increases</strong> when flowing from a wide pipe section to a narrow one[cite: 39]. The fluid speed <strong>decreases</strong> when flowing from a narrow pipe section to a wide one[cite: 40].</p>
                `,
                explanation: "The big idea of the Equation of Continuity is that what goes in must come out! If a fluid (like water) is flowing through a pipe that gets narrower, the fluid has to speed up in the narrow part to keep the same amount flowing through. So, if Area (A) goes down, velocity (v) goes up (A₁v₁ = A₂v₂).",

                    <p>Unlike fluid at rest in a uniform horizontal tube where pressure is constant, the <strong>pressure in a flowing fluid varies</strong>[cite: 43]. A <strong>pressure gradient is needed</strong> for liquid to flow through a pipe, caused by friction with pipe walls[cite: 44].</p>
                    <p>An experiment with a glass tube of varying cross-section fitted with vertical tubes (manometers) showed that the <strong>water level was lowest in the vertical tube at the narrow constriction</strong> (Y) compared to the wider sections (X and Z)[cite: 45, 46].</p>
                    <p>Observation: The pressure at the narrow constriction is lower than at X and Z. Velocity is higher at the narrow constriction[cite: 47].</p>
                `,
                explanation: "When a fluid is flowing, its pressure can change. An experiment shows this: if water flows through a pipe that gets narrow in the middle, the water level in small vertical tubes (manometers) attached to the pipe is lowest at the narrow part. This means pressure is lowest where the pipe is narrowest.",

Three vertical manometer tubes attached: one to a wide section (X), one to the narrow constriction (Y), and one to another wide section (Z). Show water flowing through the main tube and different water levels in the manometers (highest in X and Z, lowest in Y).]"

                    <p>Conclusion from experiment: The <strong>higher the speed of the fluid, the lower the pressure</strong> it exerts[cite: 48]. This relationship is known as <strong>Bernoulli’s effect</strong>[cite: 49].</p>
                    <p><strong>Bernoulli's Principle Statement:</strong> Provided a fluid is <strong>non-viscous, incompressible, and its flow is streamline</strong>, an <strong>increase in its velocity results in a corresponding decrease in the pressure</strong> it exerts[cite: 49].</p>
                `,
                explanation: "This leads to Bernoulli's Principle: for a smoothly flowing fluid (that's not sticky or compressible), where the fluid speeds up, its pressure drops! Fast flow = low pressure. Slow flow = high pressure. This is called Bernoulli's effect.",

                explanation: "Bernoulli's Principle can be written as a cool math equation: P + ½ρv² + ρgh = constant. This means that along a path of flowing fluid, the sum of its pressure energy (P), kinetic energy (due to speed, ½ρv²), and potential energy (due to height, ρgh) always stays the same.",
