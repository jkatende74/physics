                    <p>A <strong>tuning fork</strong> produces sound when its prongs vibrate after being struck. The sound is heard more clearly when the stem is fixed tightly on a hollow box or pressed on a bench. Making the prongs touch water causes splashing, confirming their vibration. A tuning fork with a higher frequency vibrates faster and produces a higher note.</p>

                explanation: "A tuning fork is a U-shaped metal tool. When you hit it, its arms (prongs) shake back and forth very fast (vibrate), making a pure musical note. If you touch the vibrating prongs to water, you'll see ripples – proof of vibration!",

                explanation: "An air siren makes sound by spinning a disc with holes and blowing air through them – the puffs of air create vibrations. A cog wheel (like a gear) can make sound if you hold a card against its spinning teeth – the card vibrates as it hits each tooth.",

                    <p>The <strong>Voice Box (Larynx)</strong> contains vocal cords that vibrate to produce human voice sounds.</p>
                    <p><strong>Loudspeakers</strong> are also vibrating bodies that produce sound. A moving-coil loudspeaker uses a varying electric current passed through a speech coil placed in a magnetic field. A maximum force acts on the coil, moving it. Since the current varies, the coil experiences a force that varies in magnitude and direction at the frequency of the speech. The diaphragm (cone) attached to the coil vibrates at the same frequency, setting a large mass of air into vibration and reproducing the sound. The radial field from the magnet cuts the coil turns at right angles, maximizing the force.</p>
                `,
                explanation: "Your voice comes from your 'voice box' (larynx), where tiny bands called vocal cords vibrate. Loudspeakers work similarly: an electric current makes a coil vibrate, which then makes a cone (diaphragm) vibrate, pushing air to create sound.",

                    <p>An <strong>Electric Bell</strong> produces a continuous ringing sound through a make-and-break mechanism. When the switch is closed, current magnetizes a core, which attracts a soft iron armature. A hammer attached to the armature strikes the gong. This attraction separates contacts, breaking the circuit and causing the magnetism to die off. A spring returns the armature to its original position, remaking the contact and repeating the process. The frequency of the ringing is controlled by a screw.</p>
                `,
                explanation: "An electric bell rings continuously because of a clever on-off switch. Electricity makes an electromagnet pull a hammer to hit the bell. But when it pulls, it breaks the circuit, the magnet switches off, and a spring pulls the hammer back. This closes the circuit again, and it repeats very fast!",

                    <p>These compressions and rarefactions transfer energy from particle to particle in the medium.</p>

                explanation: "When something vibrates, it pushes the air particles. This creates squashed-up areas (compressions) and spread-out areas (rarefactions) in the air. Sound travels as these squashes and stretches move through the air, carrying energy.",

                explanation: "In a sound wave, the air particles jiggle back and forth in the SAME direction the sound is travelling. This makes sound a 'longitudinal wave'.

Any faint sound heard in this experiment travels through the connecting wires, rubber, and walls of the jar.</p>
                `,
                explanation: "Sound needs 'stuff' (a medium like air, water, or solids) to travel through. It can't travel in a vacuum (empty space, like outer space).

                    <p>Sound reflection obeys the <strong>laws of reflection</strong>: the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection, and the incident wave, reflected wave, and the normal to the surface all lie in the same plane.

                    <p>The <strong>pulse-echo technique</strong> uses the reflection of sound pulses to measure distances.

                    <p><strong>Ultrasound</strong> (sound with frequency <strong>over 20 kHz</strong>) is often preferred for echo sounders and depth determination because it penetrates deeply and is easily reflected. For example, measuring the depth of the sea using echo sounders relies on sending an ultrasonic pulse and timing the return of the echo. The velocity of sound in water is around 1400 m/s. This technique is also used for under-water exploration and locating fish shoals.</p>
