                        <li><strong>Square/Rectangular plate:</strong> Construct the diagonals; the point of intersection is the COG.</li>

                    <h3>The Area of the Base:</h3>
                    <p>If the base area is large, the line through the centre of gravity remains within the base even if the body is tilted through a large angle. A body with a broad base is more stable than one with a narrow base.</p>
                    <h3>The Position of the Centre of Gravity:</h3>
                    <p>A body is more stable when its centre of gravity is as low as possible. This can be achieved by making the base heavier. Bodies with high centres of gravity are less stable.</p>
